## Our Vision 

"_The secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes." – Benjamin Disraeli_


Our vision is that every Gabrielite is a leader who develops others to their fullest potential. He believes in continuous learning and actively contributes to the School and community.

Our goal is to grow **STAR** (**S**pecial, **T**ransformed, **A**ctive and **R**eady) Gabrielites.

It is the school’s hope that students will be equipped with good values, right skills and the confidence to live a full and meaningful life both within and beyond the school gates.

As it takes the whole village to raise a child, we believe that a grabrielite's development falls on the shoulder of every adult and senior whom he interacts with. Thus we believe that our collaboration with the stakeholders (parents and communities) is crucial in order to provide our young Gabrielites with strong roots in values and the wings to fly in an increasingly complex world.

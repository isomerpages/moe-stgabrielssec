## Guitar Ensemble 

**<u>Introduction</u>**

![](/images/Guitar%20Ensemble.png)

With the apothegm “We play as one”, the St Gabriel Secondary School’s Guitar Ensemble has long since established an efficacious repertoire with her establishment back in January 2007. Under the intuitive baton and patronage of her two instructors, Mr Daniel Lim and Mr Raj, the ensemble has soared to great heights not only in the facets of prestigious performances, but also in aspiring young guitarists with an ever evolving enthusiasm and passion for the vibrant art.

Brimming with affection for the instrument fused with the abidance of discipline and respect, the Guitar Ensemble has once again succeeded in maintaining her level of expertise through the clinching of Certificate of Distinction for the biennial SYF competition as a testament to their hard work and perseverance since 2010; Silver (2011), Certificate of Accomplishment (2013), Certificate of Commendation (2015) and Certificate of Distinction (2017).

The Guitar Ensemble has also placed great emphasis on overseas performances and learning trips, with her most recent joint effort in Chiang Mai, Thailand, in 2018 alongside Yamaha Music School. These experiences have given the Mouradians an opportunity to develop their leadership and independence skills, as well as allowing them to display a spectrum of colorful music for the audience.

Under the flame of Labor Omnia Vincit, the ensemble has labored hard to achieve distinguished accomplishments.

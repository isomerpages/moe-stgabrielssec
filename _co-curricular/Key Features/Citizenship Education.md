## CITIZENSHIP EDUCATION


**The Four Desired Outcomes of Citizenship Education**

*   Firstly, our students should grow up to be loyal citizens, with a strong sense of belonging to Singapore and a strong sense of national identity, committed to the well-being, defence and security of our nation.
*   Secondly, they should show care and concern for others, and be willing to contribute actively to improve the lives of others.
*   Thirdly, in our multi-racial society, our students need to be socio-culturally sensitive and do their part to promote social cohesion and harmony.
*   Finally, our students must have the ability to reflect and respond to community, national and global issues, and to make informed and responsible decisions.

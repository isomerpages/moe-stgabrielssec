## Character & Citizenship Education 

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has been at the heart of Singapore’s education system. In CCE, students learn to be responsible to family and community; and understand their roles in shaping the future of the nation. The emerging trends and global developments that impact Singapore’s society, such as societal changes, globalization and technological advancements are taken into consideration in the development of the CCE curriculum.  

CCE is central to the Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the school’s core values (Respect, Resilience Responsibility and Care), social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are crucial for character and citizenship development of the students.

## RACIAL HARMONY CELEBRATION

This year, we commemorate Racial Harmony Day on 15 July 2022. This day, we celebrate our diversity and show gratitude for the harmony we enjoy as a nation. As part of the celebration, the school’s canteen vendors prepared delectable traditional dishes.  Our Parent Support Group (PSG) also added fun to the celebration by introducing different types of traditional games to our Gabrielites. The day was further heightened by performances and workshops conducted by our performing arts CCAs – for students, by students! It was definitely a meaningful and enjoyable Racial Harmony Day!

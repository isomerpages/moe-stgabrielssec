## Total Defence Day

**<u>Total Defence Day 2019</u>**

Theme: Together We Make Singapore Strong. 

Every year, our school celebrates Total Defence Day on 15 February. This year, we are introduced to the sixth pillar of Total Defence, Digital Defence. It is the first time a new pillar has been added to the Total Defence framework since its introduction 35 years ago. The new addition signals the critical need to guard our nation against the real threat of cyber attacks and disinformation, and the increasing importance of cyber security.

In conjunction with Total Defence Day, our students actively participated in an engaging game, Guardian of the City. Through their play, our students apply their understanding of security threats in both physical and cyber worlds. 

The Secondary 3 students also attended a National Service (NS) engagement talk and a panel discussion conducted by NS and NSF men who are former Gabrielites. The sharing was meaningful as our students gained useful insights about the rite of passage which many Singaporean sons go through after their tertiary education.

## NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS

The celebration began traditionally with the flag-raising ceremony and the Guard of Honour marching parade witnessed by our friends from Kitago Junior High School.   
To mark our 54th year as an independent nation, the entire school worked together to form a human “SG” tableau on our school parade square. 

The celebration continued in the school hall where we were entertained by quizzes hosted by our teachers who dressed up as the nation’s pioneers. We were also treated with a special sharing and an electrifying dance performance by students from Kitago Junior High School. The Teachers’ Band and students from Secondary 1E4 also performed a beautiful medley of our National Day songs before a rousing finale of community singing rounded the morning. It was a joyous occasion for everyone.

  
Happy Birthday, Singapore!

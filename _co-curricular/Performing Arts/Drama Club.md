Established in 2015, the St. Gabriel’s Drama and Debate Society aims to provide a platform for students to develop their skills of acting, script writing, production management, debating, public speaking and many more. The twice weekly sessions provide students with many opportunities to delve into and discuss issues that interest them through critical –thinking and problem-solving skills. With these discussions, they are able to present their views more confidently through drama or debate. Within a short span, our Drama and Debate Society has developed greatly and reached milestones in our journey.&nbsp;

  

We firmly believe in nurturing and grooming our students to discover their talents.&nbsp;

In their four years that they spend with us, our members will develop into confident and articulate gentlemen who have the passion to realise their dreams and bring their artistic visions to life. At the end of their secondary school journey, we hope that every member will be able to advocate, influence and effect a lasting and meaningful change in the lives of people around them

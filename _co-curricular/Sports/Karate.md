The Karate CCA had a challenging season this year. 

  

More than 70 CCA members participated actively in our weekly Friday trainings under the watchful eyes of our Coach, Mr David Thong.

  

We started the year with a recruitment drive for new members at the Annual CCA Fair in January. The static Karate demonstration by our Coach together with our Sec 2 to Sec 4 members drew a positive response. We were able to recruit Twenty two new Sec 1 members to the CCA.

  

Our members were excited to return back to face-to-face training albeit in a safer manner. Despite the safe management measures, the boys continue to display enthusiasm and commitment to honing their skills. 

  

After the announcement of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), training had to be reverted back to using the Zoom platform. After the experience from the Circuit breaker last year, our coach was well-equipped to manage our boys’ development even over the internet. Regular attendance by many our boys, as well as continued self-discipline by many of them to do physical training on their own, was a clear demonstration of their resilience and dedication to the sport. As such, this format continues to be effective even with the constraints due to the global situation. 

  

We are also proud to announce that 5 of our members were selected to be part of the National Cadet Team and National Junior Team.

<h4><strong>Welcome to SGSS Parent Support Group.</strong></h4>
<p>Formed in January 2001, our PSG works in partnership with the school towards
a common goal of helping each child achieve their best. We meet regularly
at least once a month for discussions on program and events that promote
home-school-community activities. These include talks, outdoor events,
bazaars and lots more.</p>
<p>The PSG of St. Gabriel's Secondary School was setup with the long-term
on-going perspective of a tripartite relationship with the school, parents
and pupils.</p>

<p>Since its formation, PSG has been promoting parental involvement with
the school and its programmes to foster a home-school partnership and build
a better rapport with our children in their growing years by being active
participating parents.</p>
<p><strong><em>Every Parent a Supportive Partner</em></strong>

<p>The PSG provides an environment where members come from varied backgrounds
and possess wide ranging skills and experiences, this creating a valuable
network of links for the benefit of the school, families and students.</p>

of PSG, members are encouraged to provide regular feedback and suggestions,
resulting in confidence and trust in the home-school relationship.</p>

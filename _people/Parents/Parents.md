#### **Welcome to SGSS Parent Support Group.**

Formed in January 2001, our PSG works in partnership with the school towards a common goal of helping each child achieve their best. We meet regularly at least once a month for discussions on program and events that promote home-school-community activities. These include talks, outdoor events, bazaars and lots more.

The PSG of St. Gabriel's Secondary School was setup with the long-term on-going perspective of a tripartite relationship with the school, parents and pupils.

**_Serving with Pride and Joy_**

Since its formation, PSG has been promoting parental involvement with the school and its programmes to foster a home-school partnership and build a better rapport with our children in their growing years by being active participating parents.

  

**_Every Parent a Supportive Partner_**

The PSG provides an environment where members come from varied backgrounds and possess wide ranging skills and experiences, this creating a valuable network of links for the benefit of the school, families and students.

  

**_A Voice for Parents_**

In the course of active collaboration with the school through the activities of PSG, members are encouraged to provide regular feedback and suggestions, resulting in confidence and trust in the home-school relationship.

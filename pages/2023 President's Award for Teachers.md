#### 2023 President's Award for Teachers

**_“Teaching is not just a job, it is a higher calling. Beyond imparting knowledge and skills, our teachers inspire, shape, and inculcate the right values in our young that will enable them to thrive in a rapidly changing world.”_**

-President Halimah Yacob (31st August 2023)

The President’s Award for Teachers recognises outstanding educators for their dedication and hard work in nurturing our young. We would like to extend our heartiest congratulations to our HOD/Student Management, Mr. Poh Wei Beng, for being one of the eight recipients of the award this year.

We thank God for the affirmation received for the daily work that Mr. Poh does in helping to create a conducive environment for meaningful teaching and learning to take place.

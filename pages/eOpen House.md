<h2><strong>St. Gabriel's Secondary School e-Open House</strong></h2>
<p>We will be having our e-Open House on the 16th of November 2024 from 10am.
Do join us as we share a little bit about the history of the school as
well as key programmes and initiatives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our Principal will kick off the engagement and key personnels will share
a little bit about their area of scope. We will also have Student Ambassadors
who will share about their experience as a student in SGSS and at the end,
we will answer queries that you may have.&nbsp;</p>

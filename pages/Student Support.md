Our school can help with school-going expenses and other expenses related to school programmes.

  

Only Singapore citizens are eligible for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme ([**https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance)). Students who do not meet the criteria for the MOE FAS will be helped through our **SGSS Financial Assistance Scheme**.

  

The application form can be obtained from our school’s General Office or downloaded via the link below. Completed forms together with all relevant supporting documents should be submitted to our school’s General Office or via email [**stgss@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:stgss@moe.edu.sg).

  

Please complete and submit the application form early before 24 October for the financial assistance to be effective for purchase of books and uniforms in November 2022. You may refer to the attached MOE FAS pamphlet for more information regarding the MOE FAS scheme.

The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund partners the Ministry of Education (MOE) in disbursing school pocket money to students from low-income families. Students who meet the criteria will be able to apply for the fund through their respective participating mainstream schools.

If you are struggling with a difficult situation and feel stressed as a result, you can always seek help from your form teachers, Year Heads or any other staff in school whom you trust.

  Alternatively, you can also look for the School Counsellor, Mrs. Florence Loo (@3rd floor, between The Common Space room and the Library).

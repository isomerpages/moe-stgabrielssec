2.&nbsp;<b><u>Financial Assistance from School (MOE / SGSS&nbsp;Financial Assistance)</u></b> 


Our school can help with school-going expenses and other expenses related to school programmes.

Only Singapore citizens are eligible for the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme ([**https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance**](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/financial-assistance)). Students who do not meet the criteria for the MOE FAS will be helped through our&nbsp;**SGSS Financial Assistance Scheme**.

The application form can be obtained from our school’s General Office or downloaded via the link below. Completed forms together with all relevant supporting documents should be submitted to our school’s General Office or via email&nbsp;[**stgss@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:stgss@moe.edu.sg).

Please complete and submit the application form early before 15th October each year for the financial assistance to be effective for purchase of books and uniforms in November. You may refer to the attached MOE FAS pamphlet for more information regarding the MOE FAS scheme.

3.&nbsp;**<u>Financial Assistance Outside School</u>**

*   **Straits Times Pocket Money Fund**:&nbsp;[**https://www.spmf.org.sg/howtoapply**](https://www.spmf.org.sg/howtoapply)

  

The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund partners the Ministry of Education (MOE) in disbursing school pocket money to students from low-income families. Students who meet the criteria will be able to apply for the fund through their respective participating mainstream schools. Every year, non-graduating students may apply for the fund through the schools during the 3rd/4th quarter of the year. For students who have graduated and are enrolled in new schools, they may apply for the fund the following year in January.

4.&nbsp;**<u>Seeking Support In School</u>**

If you are struggling with a difficult situation and feel stressed as a result, you can always seek help from your form teachers, Year Heads or any other staff in school whom you trust.

Alternatively, you can also look for the School Counsellor, Mrs.&nbsp;Florence Loo (@3rd floor, Sunshine Cove 1, before the Library; and Ms Marinder Kaur @ 3rd floor, Sunshine Cove 2, between The Common Space and the Library).

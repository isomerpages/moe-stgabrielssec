<p>Dear Parents/Guardians</p>
<p><strong><u>ST. GABRIEL'S FOUNDATION (SGF) VIRTUAL FLAG DAY 2024</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Thank you for entrusting your child’s education with our schools which
are managed by the Montfort Brothers of St Gabriel. Not only are we committed
to educating and equipping our students with knowledge through our Montfortian
Education Charter, but to inculcate and instil good moral values and character
building for each of our student. This is achieved through our enrichment
programmes and activities, going above and beyond the school’s curriculum
of our seven institutions under St Gabriel’s Foundation (SGF).</p>
<p>We appeal to your generosity to donate any amount in support of the work
that we do. In addition, donation of $100 and above will be eligible for
250% of tax deduction.</p>

The designated primary contact of the child would receive a Parent Gateway (PG) notification from us, directing you to the Online Registration Portal and other relevant information, from the afternoon of the S1 School Posting Day.

You will be informed of your child’s form class from 29 December 2023 onwards via PG.

##### **Full Subject-Based Banding (FSBB)**

Parents whose child is eligible to take subjects at a more demanding level (MDL) will receive the acceptance form(s) via PG. You will be required to accept/decline the offer online via Parents Gateway by 29 December 2023. For those who are not onboard with Parents Gateway, a printed form will be given to you on the first day of school (2 Jan 2024) and you will have to return the printed form by 5 Jan 2024).

Do note that 2024 Sec 1 Parents would be automatically on boarded to Parents Gateway from which details on logging in the zoom meeting will be disseminated. For parents with no PG, we strongly encourage you to come on-board Parents Gateway so that you may receive
timely information such as school announcements and consent forms. You are invited to download the free Parents Gateway mobile app on your mobile phone (available on IOS and Android platforms only) and perform a simple one-time on boarding process.

Dear Gabrielites and Parents,

Please be informed that Gabrielites from Secondary 1 to 5 will be dismissed at 12.30pm on Thursday, 12 January 2023. This will facilitate the school for preparations to release the 2022 GCE ‘O’ Level results.

Students from Secondary 4NA and Secondary 3 (2022) who took ‘O’ Level subjects in 2022 will be required to remain in school to collect their results. They will be required to assemble in the school hall at 1.30pm.

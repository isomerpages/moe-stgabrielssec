Dear Parents / Guardians,

Please be informed that the GCE O Level Mother Tongue Listening Comprehension (LC) examination will be held on 4 July 2023 from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. 

As such, the school will end lessons earlier at 1 p.m. to facilitate the preparation of this national examination.

All students will be dismissed at 1 p.m. on 4 July 2023 except for the exam candidates taking this O Level LC examination and the Sec 3 students scheduled for EL oral exam that day.

Thank you and have a pleasant day.

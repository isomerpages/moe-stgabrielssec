Dear Parents/Guardians,

Due to the Presidential Election on 1st September, the Teacher's Day holiday has been shifted to 11th September 2023, Monday. This coincides with the first day of the GCE 'N' Level Examination. As such, papers that were initially scheduled on 11th September have now been postponed to 12th September. 

Click here to refer to the updated exam timetable to view the papers affected by the shift.

We would greatly appreciate it if you could inform your son/ward about this change as well.

The updated timetable will also be available on our school website for your reference as well.

Thank you.

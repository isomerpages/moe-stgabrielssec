Dear Parents/Guardians,

The GCE 'N' Level Listening Comprehension will take place on 12th September 2023, Tuesday and 20th September 2023, Wednesday. 

In lieu of this, students will dismissed at 1.30pm so that the school can prepare for the examinations.

We hope that you can make the necessary transport arrangements for these 2 days for your son/ward if you are planning to fetch him home.

Thank you for your kind understanding.

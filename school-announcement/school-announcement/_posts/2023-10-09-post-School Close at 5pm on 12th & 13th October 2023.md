Dear Parents/Guardians,

In view of the coming exam, Friday 22nd September will be a normal school day, instead of HBL, for all students where we will follow our Odd Friday's timetable.

We will also be having our Thanksgiving Mass that day so that all students can express their gratitude to God for the blessings we received for the year as well as to seek God's guidance especially with the coming exam.

Your child has been informed of this change in timetable. Please remind them of this change as well.

Thank you.

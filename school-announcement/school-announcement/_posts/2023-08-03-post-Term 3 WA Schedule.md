Dear parents/guardians,

Please note for Tuesday 8 August, we are having our National Day celebration in school and students are encouraged to come in their red tops with school shorts (for lower sec students) or school pants (for upper sec students) to join in the celebration of Singapore's birthday. <br>On this day, students will be dismissed from school by 10.45 am.

Also, school will be closed on Wednesday 9 August (public holiday) and Thursday 10 August (school holiday). Students are expected to report back to school on Friday 11 August.

Thank you.

#### Outstanding Youth in Education Award

The Outstanding Youth in Education Award is a national award that recognises young teachers for their commendable enthusiasm, energy, and for being inspiring role models for the fraternity. 

It gives us great pride to share that Ms Khairunnisa Binte Ismail from our Gabrielite family was one of the six young teachers who was conferred the award in 2023. 

We are blessed beyond measure to have teachers with an amazing heart for students in our midst!

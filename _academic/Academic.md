At St. Gabriel's Secondary, we provide meaningful and authentic learning experiences for our students through different educational experiences in the different subject areas. Different pedagogical approaches such as Assessment for Learning, Field Work, Problem-based Learning and Inquiry Approach are utilized to deliver the curriculum. To cater to the varied learning needs of our students, there is also curriculum differentiation to better prepare them for the 21st century.

## Science

_**Learning is a walk of discovery, playing is the highest form of research.**_  

**Introduction**

The aim of the Science Education programme at St. Gabriel’s Secondary School (SGSS) is to

*   enthuse Gabrielites to learn, live and love Science
*   nurture Gabrielites to be inquirers and innovators that are steeped in values

The SGSS Science curriculum aligns itself to the MOE CPDD’s Science curriculum framework, which seeks to inculcate students with strong fundamentals in Science for life, learning, citizenry and work. With the **three Ins** – Inspire, Inquire, Innovate, as the vision of Science Education, the goals of Science Education are to:

a. Enthuse and nurture all students to be scientifically literate, so that they are able to make informed decisions and take responsible actions in their daily lives; and

b. Provide strong Science fundamentals for students to innovate and pursue STEM for future learning and work.

<p>The Aesthetics department is committed to increase opportunities for all
students to participate in and recognize the value of the Arts in society.
The department strives to expose all pupils to appreciating and expressing
Art through a variety of platforms. Our aim is for them to become life-long
learners who are confident and creative with a passion for life and learning.</p>
<p>Through the Arts, pupils are more aware of the values and roles of the
Arts in society, thus connecting them to our history, culture and heritage.
Pupils also learn to respect the culture, belief systems and values of
others and to appreciate the deeper forms of beauty in life.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to explore, to create, and to reach their full
potential through our wide variety of arts exposure programmes in school.
We believe that the Arts drive creativity and creativity drives learning
and when there is learning, students will grow and flourish abundantly.</p>

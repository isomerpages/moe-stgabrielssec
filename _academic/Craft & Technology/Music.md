<h5><u>Programmes</u></h5>
<p>The music unit believes that every child can learn and express themselves
better through music. As such, the music programme in St. Gabriel’s Secondary
School caters to all students in Express, Normal (Academic) and Normal
(Technical) streams. Students in the various streams are exposed to music
from various genres and they have the opportunities to learn to play musical
instruments use in mainstream culture. The various performance opportunities
during school events nurture our young Gabrielites into a confident and
outspoken gentleman who is capable of becoming a true servant leader in
the school and to the community.</p>
<h5><u>Lower Secondary Music Syllabus</u></h5>
<p>The 2 years Lower Secondary Music Syllabus in St. Gabriel’s Secondary
School is a progressive and intensive programme in which the school aim
to nurture our boys into a confident gentleman. The curriculum in our school
is planned in accordance to the latest MOE Framework of Teaching and Learning
(updated September 2018) in which the five Learning Objectives are taught
in an integrative manner. The teaching and learning of repertoire and culture
(i.e LO4) and musical concepts (i.e LO5) should be woven into active musical
experiences in the classroom (LO1, LO2, LO3).</p>
<p>Learning in the music room is always an enriching, engaging and fun-filled
moments! While the learning of musical instruments could be based on the
individual competency, students learn in an inclusive environment in which
students are always placed in small groups. Through group learning, students
are often engaged in group work, or cooperative learning. Also, group work
enhances students’ communication skills in which they can evaluate and
solve problems which arises during their practicing.</p>
<h5><u>Curriculum</u></h5>
<p>The curriculum for our Gabrielites aim at building listening and instrumental
skills. Real-life, relevant and popular music is used to stimulate awareness
on different music types and students learn to understand and recreate
them in the music classroom. Secondary 1 students learn about basic music
theory such as rhythms and time signature and apply it on the performance
of the Cajon in a group setting. They will proceed on to the learning of
chords progression on the guitar at a later stage. Secondary 2 students
learn how to play the keyboard and compose Electronic music using sequencing
software such as Garageband on the iPad. These musical skills are put to
even better use when they have the opportunities to perform at school events
such as Speech Day and recess time performance.</p>

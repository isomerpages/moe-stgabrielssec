_<center>In white and blue, boys full of mirth and life_
	
_From early morn, we flood the green playground_

_In every hall, soon starts the daily strife_

_Of school routine, lessons and work all round_

_With spirits bright, our will we'll gladly bracing_

_From teachers kind we learn what's good and right_

_We thus do hope to attain with God's blessing_

_Virtue and Truth, Virtue and Truth_

_Of life's true beacon light_

_Saint Gabriel's School Dear_

_Here willing hearts behold_

_hen duty's call rings clear_

_'Mid sorrows as through joys_

_For Singapore and God_

_For justice to uphold_

_Let us live and thus prove_

_Saint Gabriel's boys_

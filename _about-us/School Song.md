## School Song


<img src="/images/schoolsong.jpeg" style= "width: 80%;  align = center">

<br>

In white and blue, boys full of mirth and life
	
From early morn, we flood the green playground

In every hall, soon starts the daily strife

Of school routine, lessons and work all round

With spirits bright, our will we'll gladly bracing

From teachers kind we learn what's good and right

We thus do hope to attain with God's blessing

Virtue and Truth, Virtue and Truth

Of life's true beacon light

Saint Gabriel's School Dear

Here willing hearts behold

When duty's call rings clear

'Mid sorrows as through joys

For Singapore and God

For justice to uphold

Let us live and thus prove

Saint Gabriel's boys

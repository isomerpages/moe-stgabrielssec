_<center>In white and blue, boys full of mirth and life</center>_
	
_<center>From early morn, we flood the green playground</center>_

_<center>In every hall, soon starts the daily strife</center>_

_<center>Of school routine, lessons and work all round</center>_

_<center>With spirits bright, our will we'll gladly bracing</center>_

_<center>From teachers kind we learn what's good and right</center>_

_<center>We thus do hope to attain with God's blessing</center>_

_<center>Virtue and Truth, Virtue and Truth</center>_

_<center>Of life's true beacon light</center>_

<br>

_<center>Saint Gabriel's School Dear</center>_

_<center>Here willing hearts behold</center>_

_<center>When duty's call rings clear</center>_

_<center>'Mid sorrows as through joys</center>_

_<center>For Singapore and God</center>_

_<center>For justice to uphold</center>_

_<center>Let us live and thus prove</center>_

_<center>Saint Gabriel's boys</center>_

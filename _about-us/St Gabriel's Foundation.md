**Establishment of the SGF**

  

It was established in 2001 to govern, manage and administer the schools and institutions currently under the Brothers of St. Gabriel in Singapore and any other such establishment as may be determined by the Foundation from time to time.

  

The main object of the foundation is to do such work as to help people who are in conditions of need, hardship or distress, and to educate and assist our children and youth that they may grow as persons.

  

  

**Our Mission**

  

To provide educational and welfare opportunities in a creative and sustained manner that develop the fullness of the human persons according to their God-given potential.

  

  

**Our Vision**

  

We are the catalyst for a people fully developed and fully alive to their own dignity as part of humanity.

  

  

**Our Motto**

  

**Labor Omnia Vincit _(Work Conquers All)_**

  

“Labor Omnia Vincit” is a Latin motto which stands for “Labour conquers all things”.

Hard work embodied in diligence and perseverance leads one to achieve greater things in life.

It can thus be said that in whatever you do, do your best.

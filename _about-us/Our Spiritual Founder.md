## Our Spiritual Founder


**Born in times of spiritual impoverishment**

It was a time of discoveries, both of new lands and in science. A spirit of enquiry and of adventure reigned supreme.

It was also a time of great impoverishment of those who already possessed but little. Massive hunger and migration from the rural to the cities, and then to the new territories were common. The social and moral upheavals of the time were accompanied by spiritual impoverishment and corruption in high places.

**A seeker of true Wisdom**

Montfort, a man of great vitality, indomitable courage and spiritual strength was a seeker after the only treasure that mattered: Divine Wisdom. He was fascinated by the folly of the God who humbled himself so that human persons may be raised up.

He was equally concerned about the human race, the most brilliant of God's creation. By giving himself up to the ways of Wisdom, Montfort became a person transformed. In the process he developed a pedagogy of acquiring true Wisdom that not only guided his own inner journey but also the lives of all those he touched.

## Our Spiritual Founder

**Born in times of spiritual impoverishment**

Louis Marie Grignion de Montfort (1673-1716) lived at a time of transition. It was a time of discoveries, both of new lands and in science. A spirit of enquiry and of adventure reigned supreme.

It was also a time of great impoverishment of those who already possessed but little. Massive hunger and migration from the rural to the cities, and then to the new territories were common. The social and moral upheavals of the time were accompanied by spiritual impoverishment and corruption in high places.

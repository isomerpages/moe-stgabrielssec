<h2>Our Heritage</h2>
<h4>School History</h4>
<p>Saint Gabriel's School started on 1 June 1953 as a small school with 212
students in five classes from Primary One to Standard Two. The students
were taught by seven teachers, under the direction of the late Reverend
Brother Louis Gonzaga.</p>
<p>Reverend Brother Elzear officially took charge of the school on 3 May
1954. In 1958, the enrolment increased to 970, with 640 pupils in the morning
session and 330 pupils in the afternoon. In 1959, the school became a full
school with the first Secondary Four class and in 1960, these students
sat for the Senior Cambridge Examinations for the first time. In 1969,
the school became two separate schools - primary and secondary. The Primary
School moved into its new premises at Highland Road with an enrolment of
1350 boys. St Gabriel’s Secondary School continued functioning at 798 Upper
Serangoon Road as a single-session school under the leadership of the long
serving late Reverend Brother Emmanuel.</p>
<p>In 1984, Mr John Teo became the school’s first lay Principal, ending a
line of clerics who have led the school honourably. In 1990, the school
was lead by its first and only female Principal, Mrs Ng Peng Hock. With
the increasing student enrolment, the school soon needed larger premises.
A piece of land at Serangoon Avenue 1 for the new school campus was identified
in exchange for the Upper Serangoon Road site. The school moved into the
new building at the end of 1992.</p>
<p>The school celebrated its Golden Jubilee in 2003. The year also mark a
change in architecture when a big portion of the Tien (天) building was
demolished and the school moved to a new wing that was built on the old
school field. In 2018, the school commemorated its 65th&nbsp;anniversary
by sealing a time capsule that will be opened in 2053. The event also marked
the unveiling of the Old Cross that was salvaged from the old campus symbolising
a continuity of traditions and heritage that had started from 1953.</p>
<h4>The Story of the Old Cross</h4>
<p>Dubbed the ‘Homecoming’, the 65th&nbsp;Anniversary celebrations at St
Gabriel’s Secondary School on 17th&nbsp;November 2018 was more than the
homecoming of students. It marked the unveiling of a gallery that holds
three important monuments, one of which had been brought from the gate
of former school site.</p>

<p>In 2016, the gate at the former school site had to be demolished. It had
witnessed the growth of the school from its infancy. It was one of the
first structures that was built when St Gabriel’s School moved into its
first home after being hosted by Montfort School for several years. It
greeted the boys when they come to school and bade them goodbye when they
leave. The gate bears testimony to the laughters and the tears of St Gabriel’s
boys for the many good years that the school was at 795 Upper Serangoon
Road.</p>
<p>After the primary school section moved out to its own location at Highland
Road, the gate continued to greet the boys in the secondary school. When
the secondary school move out in 1992 to the present site, the gate stood
resolutely at the old grounds as a historical signpost to mark the school
past. Old Boys still visit the old site to take photographs and reminisce
their younger, glorious days.</p>

<p>However, in 2016, a road widening project on Upper Serangoon Road caused
the gate that the Old Cross had stood on since the 1950s to be demolished.
To commemorate it, the school built a replica of the gate as part of the
Heritage Gallery in the current site to allow the memory of the cultural
landmark to be preserved. The school’s history and the social history of
the Upper Serangoon neighbourhood was incorporated into the Heritage Gallery.</p>

<p>At the same time, Old Boys and school staff endeavored to salvage Old
Cross that had stood on the gate to the present school site. Their unwavering
and tireless efforts convinced the government authorities to allow for
the school to be present during the demolition of the gate to retrieve
the cross. A handful of Old Boys, former staff and current school staff
were present at the poignant moment. The Old Cross was then brought to
the St Gabriel’s Secondary School site at Serangoon Avenue 1 for safe-keeping.</p>

<p>In 2018, the school decided to commemorate the 65th anniversary with the
homecoming of the Old Cross. Placed at a vantage position at the school
foyer, the Old Cross will once again bear witness to journey of every St
Gabriel’s boy who stepped his foot in the school.</p>
<p>As part of a trinity of monuments, the Old Cross symbolises the school
heritage. The statue of St. Louis-Marie De Montfort adjacent to it represents
the school Montfortian identity. Completing the trinity is a Time Capsule
that symbolizes the school’s future aspirations. The Time Capsule will
be opened in 2053 at the school’s centennial anniversary.</p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>The time capsule bears artefact that tells the school’s rich history and
preserves its present memories. It also bears the aspirations of the school
leaders, teachers and students for the school. Several letters too, were
placed into the Time Capsule addressed to students and school staff in
2053. It was hoped that these letters will be read at the opening of the
Time Capsule in 2053.</p>
<p>Inscribed on the capsule cover are these words: -</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>With God’s blessing, may the experience represented in this collection be a Light of Virtue and a Beacon of Truth to inspire future students to live and thus prove to be worthy St Gabriel’s boys</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>Once a Gabrielite; Always a Gabrielite.</em>

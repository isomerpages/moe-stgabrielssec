## EDUCATION AND CAREER GUIDANCE

Education and Career Guidance (ECG) is about equipping students with the necessary knowledge, skills and values to make informed decisions at each key education stage for successful transition from school to further education or work, and hence to manage their career pathways and lifelong learning throughout their lives. Through ECG, social emotional competencies and qualities of proactivity, adaptability and resilience are developed to prepare students for the 21st Century.  

  

**Our Belief**

ECG is the main motivating factor for students to find meaning in coming to school.

  

In St. Gabriel’s, we aim to develop self-directed and resilient students who seek continuous learning and growth.

  

**Student Outcomes:**

*   Pro-active
*   Adaptive
*   Resilent
*   Future Ready

  

**Our ECG Objectives:**

*   To build confident students by deepening their self-awareness of their interests, abilities and values
*   To help students make informed choices of various education and career pathways
*   To equip students with future ready skills

## About Us

Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) has been at the heart of Singapore’s education system. In CCE, students learn to be responsible to family and community; and understand their roles in shaping the future of the nation. The emerging trends and global developments that impact Singapore’s society, such as societal changes, globalization and technological advancements are taken into consideration in the development of the CCE curriculum.  

CCE is central to the Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes. It emphasizes the interconnectedness of the school’s core values (Respect, Resilience Responsibility and Care), social and emotional competencies and civic literacy, global awareness and cross-cultural skills that are crucial for character and citizenship development of the students.

**Framework for 21st Century Competencies and Student Outcomes**

### Our Vision 

"_The secret to success in life is for a man to be ready for his opportunity when it comes." – Benjamin Disraeli_


Our vision is that every Gabrielite is a leader who develops others to their fullest potential. He believes in continuous learning and actively contributes to the School and community.

Our goal is to grow **STAR** (**S**pecial, **T**ransformed, **A**ctive and **R**eady) Gabrielites.

It is the school’s hope that students will be equipped with good values, right skills and the confidence to live a full and meaningful life both within and beyond the school gates.

As it takes the whole village to raise a child, we believe that a grabrielite's development falls on the shoulder of every adult and senior whom he interacts with. Thus we believe that our collaboration with the stakeholders (parents and communities) is crucial in order to provide our young Gabrielites with strong roots in values and the wings to fly in an increasingly complex world.

### Our Framework 

**“Give me a place to stand and I can move the world”. – Archimedes**

Guided by the school’s vision: The Gabrielite… a Servant Leader, Lifelong Learner and Gracious Citizen, the student outcome for each level state what we want our students to learn and attain in CCE, and to guide the development of the curriculum for CCE.

The CCE team, which comprises Values Education, Citizenship Education, Service and Leadership, CCA, together with Student Support and Student Management team, seek to provide an integrated, comprehensive curriculum, designed to support students in their growth and needs as well as provide opportunities for character and citizenship development. We aim to help Gabrielites acquire and live by values that guide them to make good choices, and develop positive attitudes and behaviour towards themselves, their families and the community at large.

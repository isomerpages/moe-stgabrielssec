## Total Defence Day

**<u>Total Defence Day 2023</u>**

Theme: Our Unity is Our Strength

Every year, our school celebrates Total Defence Day on 15 February. With food security being the focus this year, through various classroom activities, our students learnt that strengthening our food security is a whole-nation effort and that everyone has an important role to play. This is how we can contribute to Psychological and Economic Defence and do our part for Total Defence.

In addition, as part of Total Defence Day commemoration, we partnered with Singapore Police Force (SPF) to hold an exhibition in school with banners, game booths and a showcase of a police vehicle.

The Secondary 3 students also attended a National Service (NS) engagement talk and a panel discussion conducted by NS and NSF men who are former Gabrielites. The sharing was meaningful as our students gained useful insights about the rite of passage which many Singaporean sons go through after their tertiary education.

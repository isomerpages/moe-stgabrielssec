## EMPATHY WEEK

In 2021, Empathy Day was inaugurated with the aim of celebrating inclusivity with our Secondary 1 to 3 students and this was expanded to include the Secondary 4 and 5 students in 2022. Since then, the programme has evolved to become Empathy Week with our students engaging in meaningful activities over a week in April to coincide with our school’s Founder’s Day. It offers students the opportunity to share, educate and learn from the life experiences of individuals in our community so as to develop empathy. 

*	Secondary 1 students designed posters as a pledge against bullying in a specially developed anti-bullying lesson.

*	Secondary 2 students were led by their Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) in a mental-wellness lesson during which they learnt to look out and care for one another and themselves. 

* Secondary 3 students were engaged in an experience-based lesson, aptly titled ‘Walk a Mile’, on inclusivity with a focus on the struggles of individuals with disabilities. 

* Secondary 4 and 5 students interviewed the everyday heroes within the school community and shared a compelling story via a video. 

This year, Empathy Week took place between 21st and 28th April 2023 and proved to be a meaningful experience and engagement for our students.

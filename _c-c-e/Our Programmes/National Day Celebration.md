## NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS

The celebration began traditionally with the flag-raising ceremony and the Guard of Honour marching parade witnessed by our friends from Kitago Junior High School.&nbsp;  
To mark our 54th year as an independent nation, the entire school worked together to form a human “SG” tableau on our school parade square.&nbsp;

The celebration continued in the school hall where we were entertained by quizzes hosted by our teachers who dressed up as the nation’s pioneers. We were also treated with a special sharing and an electrifying dance performance by students from Kitago Junior High School. The Teachers’ Band and students from Secondary 1E4 also performed a beautiful medley of our National Day songs before a rousing finale of community singing rounded the morning. It was a joyous occasion for everyone.

Happy Birthday, Singapore!

## NATIONAL DAY CELEBRATIONS

The celebration began traditionally with the flag-raising ceremony and the Guard of Honour marching parade. To mark our 57th year as an independent nation, our students created paper hearts and expressed how they would like to do a good deed for the nation. The paper hearts were then placed on display at the school foyer, drawing crowds of students, parents and teachers.  

The celebration continued in the school hall where we were entertained by quizzes hosted by our teachers who dressed up as national icons and pioneers. We were also treated by performances by our school Band and the Guitar Ensemble. As a school, we ended the celebrations with one heartbeat as we sang National Day songs. It was a joyous occasion for everyone.

Happy Birthday, Singapore!

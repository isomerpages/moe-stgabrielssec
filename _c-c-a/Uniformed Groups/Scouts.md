## Scouts

##### <u>Introduction</u>
Founded in 1958, the 2006 Southern Cross Scouts Troop celebrated its 65th anniversary recently by organising a campfire which amassed over 300 scouts and girl guides from over 30 units across the island. The campfire was a good platform for scouts to showcase their complex scouting skills and stage their talents in acting and dancing. 

The passion for scouting propelled the scouts to consistently share their camp craft, pioneering and orienteering skills with their juniors from St. Gabriel's primary school through various activities like hiking at rifle range nature park and termly pioneering workshops.

Additionally, the troop made history this year by receiving the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) medal for all three scouting sections - Scouts, Ventures and Rovers. Eight of our Scouts received the Scouts Chief Commissioner’s Award, the highest award a scout may receive in their scouting adventure at the secondary school level.

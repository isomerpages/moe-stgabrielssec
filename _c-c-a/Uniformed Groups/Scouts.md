## Scouts

##### <u>Introduction</u>
Mr. Francis Khoo and Mr. Francis Sim, two St. Gabriel's teachers, created the 2006 Southern Cross Scout Troop (also known as the 62nd SGS Group) on June 5, 1958. <br>The Scout Troop (Sec 1-3s), Venture Unit (Sec 4s and above), and Rover Crew make up our 2006 Southern Cross Group (Adult volunteers). Scouts are taught through the Scout Promise, which encourages everyone to serve the public as a form of Duty to God and to follow the Scout Law. We are one of Singapore's oldest Scout Units, with a rich history and culture. In 2018, the troop had their 60th Anniversary Campfire, which was attended by Scouts and Guides from over 20 different schools.

Since 2010, our Scout Troop has earned the Frank Cooper Sands (Gold) medal every year. In 2010, we achieved a significant milestone by receiving the Gold medal for both our Scout Troop and Venture Unit. Our Scout Troop also received a Silver Award at the 2018 National Patrol Camp, which was held to assess the standards of all of Singapore's Scout Troops. Six of our Scouts received the Scouts Chief Commissioner's Award in 2021, the greatest award a scout may receive in their scouting adventure at the secondary school level, and one of our Venture Scouts received the President's Scout Award, the highest rank in the Singapore Scout Association.

The Troop also takes part in events at the Area and National levels, such as campfires, contests, and service projects. Due to Covid-19, the Troop was prepared to conduct E-CCA, which included training via Zoom and online updates of their progress with guidance from the alumni. The scouts continue to carry out scouting activities and learning new scouting skills and even participated in East Area Scouting at Home 2021.

In 2022, the Scouts planned training and activities where there were opportunities to continue patrol bonding among them. They also forged new relationships with their juniors from St. Gabriel’s Primary School. Additionally, the troop made history by taking part in the National Day Parade and Braddell Heights Mini Parade 2022.

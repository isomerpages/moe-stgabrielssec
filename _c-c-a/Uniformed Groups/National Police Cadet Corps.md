<h2>NATIONAL POLICE CADET CORPS</h2>
<h4>Beliefs &amp; Outcomes</h4>
<p>Our mission is to develop our members to be active citizens and community
leaders, by working in partnership with the Singapore Police Force to fight
crime and keep Singapore safe. The Corps aims to provide students with
authentic learning experiences which will help them to develop important
qualities based on the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) values of RISE
– Resilience, Integrity, Service and Excellence. Activities are planned
with the cadet’s learning and development of knowledge, skills and values
in mind. This ensures a meaningful and holistic CCA experience for the
cadet. Apart from learning hard skills in terms of drills, commands, knots
and lashings, cadets also try their hands at various enrichment activities,
such as rock-climbing, air pistol shooting and football clinics, which
also serve to bond the Unit. Cadets are exposed to courses such as Crime
Scene Investigation and First Aid, and have the opportunity to shoot a
revolver in Secondary 2 and 3. Every year, we provide our cadets with opportunities
for overseas exchange with Brunei and Hong Kong, and bond with cadets from
other Units at Pulau Ubin NPCC Camp Resilience.</p>

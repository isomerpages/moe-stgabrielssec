**Introduction**

In St. Gabriel's NCC (Air) Squadron, you will go through a series of activities and courses planned for you, e.g. basic aero-modelling skills and knowledge, leadership training camps, parades and many other meaningful activities. The Squadron will also give opportunities for cadets to be immersed in other key activities offered by NCC (Land) and (Sea) and selected cadets may even represent the Squadron in Overseas Exchange Programmes.

The skills and knowledge you acquire will serve you well... even after you graduate!

To date, St Gabriel's NCC (Air) Unit has garnered the Gold Award in BUC ever since the Unit was introduced back in January 2000.

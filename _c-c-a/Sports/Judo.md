<center> 2023 C Division Judo Team </center>

This year 2023, our Judokas have once again captured a total of 3 individual medals (1 Silver and 2 Bronze) in the B Division 54th National Inter-School Individual Judo Championship held in May and in the end our school emerged overall 4th at the National level amongst 16th schools participating in the B division after many closely contested fights. 

For the C Division as the NSG took place in July, our boys have achieved even better results by getting the National 2nd place with a total of 5 medals (1 Gold, 3 Silvers and 1 Bronze) as they have been training very hard since the post pandemic in order to do well and bring glory to our school.

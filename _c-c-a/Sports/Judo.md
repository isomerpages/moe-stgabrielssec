## Judo 

##### <u>Introduction</u>
For our Judo at St Gabriel’s Sec School, we strive to foster a lifelong passion for the sport in our boys so as to be able to grow from strength to strength over the years. We seek to provide quality training and activities to bring out the best of each individual, both on and off the mats. We are focused on developing motor skills as well as instilling important martial arts and life values such as self-awareness, confidence, care, respect, responsibility and etiquette. Working closely with our stakeholders, partners and parents, we are constantly innovating and adapting, to face challenges that lie ahead especially in such trying times.

2022 National Schools C Division Boys as National 2nd

Since the last National School Games in 2018 followed by the Covid interruption for&nbsp;two years, the NSG has finally resumed in 2022. Our Judokas have once again done&nbsp;the school proud by capturing a total of 3 individual medals \[1 Gold and 2 Bronze\] in&nbsp;the B Division 53rd National Inter-School Individual Judo Championship held in April&nbsp;and in the end our school emerged overall 2nd runner-up at the National level after&nbsp;many closely contested fights. In the C Division 53rd National Inter-School Individual&nbsp;Judo Championship held in July our boys performed even better with \[2 Gold, 1 Silver and 2 Bronze medals\] and our school emerged overall 2nd nationally. Despite&nbsp;the lack of training during the pandemic, our boys still trained very hard once&nbsp;measures were eased and thus their tenacity and perseverance certainly helped&nbsp;them to achieve the good results.

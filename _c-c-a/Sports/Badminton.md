## Badminton

##### <u>Introduction</u> 

Badminton is a demanding sport that requires excellent fitness and commitment from its players. 

In St Gabrielâ€™s badminton team, we believed in inculcating our players with the right attitude of good sportsmanship.

In order to grow as a player, we believed one must be committed, determined, and humble.

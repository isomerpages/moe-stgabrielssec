<h2>Golf</h2>
<h5>Beliefs &amp; Outcomes</h5>
<p>Golf is a refined and dynamic sport that sharpens both technical skills
and character through consistent training and competition. At St. Gabriel’s,
we welcome students who are passionate about golf and eager to challenge
themselves, whether as individuals or proud representatives of our school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, our school competes in the prestigious National Golf Championships
in both the ‘B’ and ‘C’ Divisions. Students in the competitive group have
the flexibility to train either with professional coaches at the club or
follow personalised training schedules, preparing themselves for these
significant events. For students with a handicap of 18 or below, we strongly
encourage participation in try-outs for individual entry into the National
Golf Championships.</p>
<p>As part of the renowned Youth Golf Programme, endorsed by Youth Golf Network
Ltd., our golfers benefit from expert coaching by professionals at Orchid
Country Club Golf Course. This mentorship helps our students grow not only
in skill, but also in sportsmanship and mental resilience. Students are
expected to bring their own golf equipment to training sessions and adhere
to the appropriate golf attire.</p>
<p>At St. Gabriel’s, our Golf CCA is more than just a team — it is a family
of like-minded individuals bound by a shared love for the sport. During
challenging moments, we draw strength from one another, supporting and
motivating one another to overcome obstacles. Our golfers are not only
highly skilled but also mentally tough, working together toward a common
goal to achieve success.</p>

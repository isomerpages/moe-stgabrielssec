## Golf 

##### <u>Introduction</u>

St. Gabriel's Golf CCA was started in 2003. Currently, our boys undergo the Youth Golf training program at the **Orchid Country Club**, conducted by a team of professional golf coaches. Besides golfing techniques and golf course management, character building is an important and integral part of our training emphasis.

Thanks to the valiant effort of our golfers, St. Gabriel’s Secondary has consistently attained top 4 in the National Golf Tournament for the past **16 years**.

![](/images/20191025_Infocomm_image1.jpeg)

Under the guidance of Ms Nisa, together with Ms Syarmeen and Mdm Rose, the Club continues to push its boundaries – exploring advanced techniques in Audio Visual and Photography. The Club strives constantly to sustain standards comparable to that of industrial professionals. Members of the Infocomm Club have been winning praises for the effort and commitment in rendering their service to the school.

As a CCA, we strive to do our best in every event that we are involved in as our motto states, _Look Good, Sound Good_. We hope to continue to give our best so that our audience have a memorable experience when celebrating different occasions with the school.

  

**Training sessions in 2021**

**Do take note that Infocomm Club members will be involved in all school events as well as the rehearsals for these events. This will require additional time commitment on top of the regular training sessions.**

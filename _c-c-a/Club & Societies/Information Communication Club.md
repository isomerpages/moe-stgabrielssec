## Information Communication Club

##### <u>Introduction</u>

Under the guidance of Mdm Rose, together with Mdm Hasnah, the Club continues to push its boundaries â€“ exploring advanced techniques in Audio Visual and Photography. The Club strives constantly to sustain standards comparable to that of industrial professionals. Members of the Infocomm Club have been winning praises for the effort and commitment in rendering their service to the school.

As a CCA, we strive to do our best in every event that we are involved in as our motto states,&nbsp;_Look Good, Sound Good_. We hope to continue to give our best so that our audience have a memorable experience when celebrating different occasions with the school.

## Debate Club

##### <u>Introduction</u>

Originally known as St. Gabriel’s Drama and Debate Society, the Debate Club is now an independent CCA that aims to groom students to become effective communicators and critical thinkers. Debating tournaments and exchanges with students from other schools give students opportunities to develop these skills, and weekly training sessions enable
them to continue working to hone their ability in public speaking, debating, research and case preparation. Under the close guidance and mentorship of teachers and coaches, our students are nurtured to become excellent collaborators who know how to convincingly articulate their views.

Our debaters also have chances to showcase their creativity and insight through making podcasts. The Spoken Word Podcast is a series of podcasts established by the Debate Club in 2022. It provides a platform for students to express their perspective towards a variety of topics, including student life, environment conservation and love for the nation. For students who aspire to speak to larger audiences, this is an opportunity to consider!
